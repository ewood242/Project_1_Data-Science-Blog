Libraries & Installation

This project uses Python version 3.* and the following libraries:
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn

Project Motivation

This project was the first of four in the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. While exploring the data, I wanted to know:
* How does seasonal variation impact Boston AirBnB booking prices?
* What are the most common amenities for Boston AirBnB properties?
* Which neighborhood has the most AirBnB properties and how does that correlate to pricing?

Repository Files

The Jupiter Notebook File titled "Project_1_Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post.ipynb" shows the relevant data processing and analysis used to answer the three questions above. 

This project utilizes Boston Airbnb data, wich is available through Kaggle.com here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston. The data set consists of three csv files:
* calendar.csv - This file contains 4 columns ('listing_id', 'date', 'available', 'price') and 1,308,890 rows of data pertaining to the price of each AirBnB listing on each date the property was available. 
* listings.csv - This file contains 95 columns and 3,585 rows of data pertaining to specific listing information, such as descriptions, host information, location details, etc. 
* reviews.csv - This file contains 6 columns and 68,275 rows of data pertaining to reviews for each listing. 

Conclusion
